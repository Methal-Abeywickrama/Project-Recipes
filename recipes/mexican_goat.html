  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Easy to follow recipe, that delivered the most delicious birria. It was my first time making it and it tasted exactly like what my family has made over the years. They couldn't tell me how they make it because they simply do it by memory without measurements, so this worked great.</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>2 pounds plum tomatoes</li>
    <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
    <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
    <li>1 (16 ounce) jar spaghetti sauce</li>
    <li>3 whole black peppercorns</li>
    <li>Â½ pound shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
    <li>1 pinch ground cumin</li>
    <li>1 pint ricotta cheese</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Bring a pot of water to a boil; add ancho chile peppers and cook for 5 minutes. Remove from heat and let chiles soak in the hot water until soft, about 10 minutes; drain.</li>
    <li>Blend softened chiles, 1 cup vinegar, 15 peppercorns, ginger, 2 garlic cloves, 3 cloves, 1 pinch marjoram, 1 pinch cumin, and 1 pinch thyme in a blender until marinade is smooth. Strain marinade into a bowl.</li>
    <li>Place goat in a bowl and pour in marinade, coating goat completely. Cover and refrigerate for 8 hours.</li>
    <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Transfer goat and marinade to a baking dish; cover with a lid or aluminum foil.</li>
  </ol>
